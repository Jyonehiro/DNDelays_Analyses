Study Description: 
Children often behave impulsively. Imposing a delay before children can act appears to reduce their impulsive behaviors, supporting inhibitory control. However, some prior studies that imposed delays also added reminders about what children should be doing. Attempts to isolate the effects of delays have yielded mixed results: Delays alone did not did not improve inhibitory control in a go/no-go box-search task (Barker & Munakata, 2015), but delays alone did improve inhibitory control in a day-night Stroop task (Ling et al., 2016), in which children were asked to say “day” when shown a picture of a moon and “night” when shown a picture of a sun. The current study tested the possibility that the positive message provided during the Day-Night delay ("I hope you have a nice time; I like you") improved children’s performance. Sixty-eight 3.5 - 5.0 year-old children were tested with a delay with neutral content (“la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la’') imposed either just after they were shown each picture or in between trials. The neutral delay just before children could act improved performance. Such benefits of delays may depend upon the complexity of inhibitory control demands, children’s age, and the visibility of impulse-inducing targets, all of which may influence how children use additional time.
